The first three days in workshop where  half boring and half interesting.They are talking about the the values and these values are not totally acceptable and some are very inspiring .Because some value like remembering why i am  here are i s a self helping analysis to understand i need to change the ideas and thoughts that i am following in my life

And the time after that  that is when fumigations start i didnâ€™t know where the time has gone.That much interest i have that time .The process of self taught has been a self realising that i can do more in my life.Till now all is going well for me and very interested to mone forward and face the challenges
